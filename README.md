# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

In this assignment, I updated the index.html file and style.css file to follow best practices for accessibility based on the user story for Horiseon's website.

I made the following changes to optimize accessibility:

* Replaced generic div elements to proper semantic HTML elements
* Updated index.html so that it follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Added an alt atribute to each image element
* Updated the heading attributes so that they fall in to sequential order
* Updated the title element to a consise, descriptive title
* Included descriptive comments to style.css
